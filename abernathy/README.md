# miljomataren/abernathy

## Getting Started

To run the app, you need to export the environment variable `BACKEND_URL`. The backend URL should be the URL to the API, such as `http://localhost:5000` or `https://miljomataren.vilhelmprytz.se`.

You can also put this variable in a file named `.env.local`.

```bash
BACKEND_URL="http://localhost:5000"
```

You can run the app locally with the following.

```bash
npm run dev
```
